marshyon: Im running this go project in vscode devcontainer but I need to create and run dockerfile for this 

can that be done ?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, it can be done. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Create a Dockerfile in the root directory of your project. This file will define the environment in which your application will run.

```Dockerfile
# Use the official Golang image to create a build artifact.
# This is based on Debian and sets the GOPATH to /go.
# https://hub.docker.com/_/golang
FROM golang:1.16 as builder

# Copy local code to the container image.
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .

# Build the command inside the container.
# (You may fetch or manage dependencies here,
# either manually or with a tool like "go get".)
RUN go build -o server

# Use a Docker multi-stage build to create a lean production image.
# https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/#use-multi-stage-builds
FROM gcr.io/distroless/base-debian10
COPY --from=builder /app/server /server

# Run the web service on container startup.
CMD ["/server"]
```

2. Build your Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t my-golang-app .
```

3. Run your Docker container:

```bash
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 my-golang-app
```

Please replace `my-golang-app` with the name you want for your Docker image, and replace `server` with the name of your Go application. The `-p 8080:8080` option tells Docker to map port 8080 inside the Docker container to port 8080 on your machine.

Remember to adjust the Dockerfile according to your project's needs. The provided Dockerfile is a general-purpose one and might not fit your project perfectly.

marshyon: no, I get docker not found, like I say Im in vscode dev container

GitHub Copilot: If you're running in a VS Code dev container, you might not have Docker installed in your container. However, you can use Docker from the host machine where your dev container is running.

To do this, you need to install the Docker CLI in your dev container and then use the Docker daemon on the host machine. Here's how you can do it:

1. Update your `Dockerfile` to install the Docker CLI. Here's an example if you're using a Debian-based image:

```Dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg-agent \
    software-properties-common \
 && curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/$(. /etc/os-release; echo "$ID")/gpg > /tmp/dkey; apt-key add /tmp/dkey \
 && add-apt-repository \
    "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/$(. /etc/os-release; echo "$ID") \
    $(lsb_release -cs) \
    stable" \
 && apt-get update && apt-get install -y docker-ce-cli
```

2. Update your `devcontainer.json` to mount the Docker socket from the host into the dev container:

```json
{
    "runArgs": ["-v", "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock"]
}
```

Now, when you build and run your dev container, you should be able to use Docker commands inside the container, and they will be executed by the Docker daemon on the host machine.
